Last month, he coauthored a paper published in Science showing that neural-network-based approaches are rapidly becoming the leading technique for modeling materials with strong quantum properties. Meta also recently unveiled an AI model trained on a massive new data set of materials that has jumped to the top of a leaderboard for machine-learning approaches to material discovery.

They tried carbon dating ostrich eggshells they excavated, but ran into a slew of technical problems. Once they overcame those, they found the eggs were beyond the range of reliable carbon dating — more than 45,000 years old. Another dating technique put the ostrich eggs at around 75,700 years old, plus or minus 4,700 years.""

The law — which was used during the two World Wars — allows the president to arrest, imprison or deport immigrants from a country considered an enemy of the U.S. during wartime without the usual due process. Its use would draw immediate legal challenges, and legal experts are divided over how such an effort would fare in the courts. The U.S. is not at war with any of the countries from which large numbers of migrants arrive, which the language of the act requires. Courts, however, are often deferential to the executive branch over this kind of authority.""
