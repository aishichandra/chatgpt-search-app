The Marshall Project,https://www.themarshallproject.org/2024/01/18/alabama-nitrogen-execution-death-penalty,"The copy of Alabama’s new nitrogen protocol that appears in court records is heavily redacted, but if Smith is executed on Jan. 25 as scheduled, other states could begin using nitrogen in similar ways. The Marshall Project spoke with Dr. Jeffrey Keller, president of the American College of Correctional Physicians, which trains and represents doctors who work behind bars, about this moment in the history of executions. Our conversation has been edited for length and clarity.

TIME,https://time.com/3972877/chris-froome-doping-tou-de-france/,"“So to understand if it’s a unique profile or if it’s something else like doping, we need more details to understand,” said Sallet. “When people are suspicious around you, it’s my opinion, but the best answer is to give the details.” Cyclists have been regarded with suspicion since the 7-time Tour de France winner Lance Armstrong admitted doping and was stripped of his titles. Froome, the winner of the Tour in 2013, has been abused by spectators during the race who have spat, made hand gestures and on one occasion threw urine at him. There is no evidence that he has engaged in doping and he denies it.

The Washington Post,https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/10/03/port-strike-union-harold-daggett-ila-history/,"""Daggett is one of the highest paid union leaders in the country, making more than $900,000 last year, despite overseeing a moderately sized union, according to Labor Department records. Some 45,000 of the 85,000 ILA members are on strike, the union says. By contrast, the Teamsters with more than a million members paid its president $250,000 in 2023. United Auto Workers, with 370,000 workers, paid its president close to $200,000 last year.""

The Washington Post,https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/2024/07/09/thomas-dambo-trash-troll-artist/,"“That’s enough material to build two and a half million trolls,” he said. “I’d love to show people how much beauty we can create from all that trash.” In Detroit Lakes, a troll named Alexa holds a large wooden spoon over a recipe book and a cauldron, while a troll called Ronny Funny Face pokes his tongue out at anyone who stumbles across him in the woods. The tallest troll, Long Leif, towers 42 feet above the grass.

Wired,https://www.wired.com/story/far-right-militias-extremism/,"""David Gilbert: Yeah. For the last year, he told me he's been organizing a nationwide network of militias. He wants to create this group of 3,000 plus county level militias all across the country who will each answer up to a state leader and all the state leaders will answer up to the leadership council, which he's the head of. So he is rolling this out across the country and he hopes that it will be in place, I guess, within weeks or within months ahead of the 2024 election.""
