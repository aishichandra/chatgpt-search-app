TIME,https://time.com/3972877/chris-froome-doping-tou-de-france/,"“So to understand if it’s a unique profile or if it’s something else like doping, we need more details to understand,” said Sallet. “When people are suspicious around you, it’s my opinion, but the best answer is to give the details.” Cyclists have been regarded with suspicion since the 7-time Tour de France winner Lance Armstrong admitted doping and was stripped of his titles. Froome, the winner of the Tour in 2013, has been abused by spectators during the race who have spat, made hand gestures and on one occasion threw urine at him. There is no evidence that he has engaged in doping and he denies it.

Wired,https://www.wired.com/story/far-right-militias-extremism/,"""David Gilbert: Yeah. For the last year, he told me he's been organizing a nationwide network of militias. He wants to create this group of 3,000 plus county level militias all across the country who will each answer up to a state leader and all the state leaders will answer up to the leadership council, which he's the head of. So he is rolling this out across the country and he hopes that it will be in place, I guess, within weeks or within months ahead of the 2024 election.""
